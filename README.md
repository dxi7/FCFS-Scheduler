# FCFS Scheduler

This repository provides a straightforward implementation of the **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm. The project was developed during a foundational bootcamp that included an **Operating Systems** unit. The goal is to demonstrate how FCFS handles process scheduling and to highlight essential performance metrics.

## üñ•Ô∏è Introduction

In many systems, processes are queued based on their **arrival times**. The **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** scheduling algorithm ensures that each process is executed in the exact order it arrives. This approach helps in understanding **CPU scheduling fundamentals** and analyzing key performance metrics such as **waiting time** and **turnaround time**.

This project **simulates FCFS scheduling**, allowing users to visualize execution order, compute scheduling metrics, and generate a **Gantt chart** for better process tracking.

## ‚≠ê Features

- **Process Simulation:** Models process execution in an FCFS manner.
- **Queue Visualization:** Displays how processes enter and exit the ready queue.
- **Metrics Computation:** Calculates:
  - **Waiting Time:** Time spent in the queue before execution.
  - **Turnaround Time:** Total time from arrival to completion.
  - **Response Time:** The time between arrival and first execution.
- **Gantt Chart Visualization:** Generates a **graphical representation** of process execution.
- **User Input Support:** Allows dynamic input of process details.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dxi7/FCFS-Scheduler.git
```
### **Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory**
Once the cloning process is complete, move into the project directory:

```bash
cd FCFS-Scheduler
```
### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install tabulate matplotlib
```
These libraries are used for displaying tables and generating Gantt charts.

## üöÄ Usage
To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
python src/FCFS_Scheduling.py
```
### **User Input**
The program will prompt you to enter the following details:

  - **Number of processes**

  - **Arrival time of each process**

  - **Burst time (execution duration) of each process**

Once the input is provided, the program will display:

  - **A detailed process table with execution times.**

  - **Average waiting, turnaround, and response times.**

   - **A Gantt chart to visualize the execution order.**
---
## üîç Methodology
### **Algorithm Overview**
  - **The FCFS scheduling algorithm sorts processes by arrival time.**

  - **The CPU executes each process sequentially, completing one before starting the next.**

 ### **Key Scheduling Metrics:**

  - **Waiting Time (WT): Time spent waiting in the queue before execution.**

   - **Turnaround Time (TAT): Total time from process arrival to completion.**

  - **Response Time (RT): Time from process arrival to the first execution.**

## üìä Example Output
**After entering process details, the program outputs a structured table:**

```plaintext
+-----------+--------------+-----------+----------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+
| Process   | Arrival Time | Burst Time| Completion Time| Turnaround Time| Waiting Time | Response Time|
+-----------+--------------+-----------+----------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+
| P1        |      0       |     5     |        5       |       5        |      0       |      0       |
| P2        |      2       |     3     |        8       |       6        |      3       |      3       |
| P3        |      4       |     2     |       10       |       6        |      4       |      4       |
+-----------+--------------+-----------+----------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+
```
**The Gantt chart visualization clearly depicts execution order:**
```
|  P1  |  P2  |  P3  |
0      5      8     10
```
